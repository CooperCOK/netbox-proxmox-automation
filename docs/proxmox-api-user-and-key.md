# Proxmox API user + key

While the Proxmox implementation that's part of the Ansible community.general collection allows you to use passwords when doing Proxmox automation, `netbox-proxmox-automation` does not allow this behavior.

It is recommended that you do *not* create an API token for the Proxmox 'root' user.  Instead, create an `api_user` and an API token.  Then assign the required permissions to the `api_user`.  This procedure uses a combination of the Proxmox UI and the command line.  You need to be able to access Proxmox via and UI and SSH and become the 'root' user.  You will need to create an `api_user` in Proxmox, an API token, and set the requisite permissions in Proxmox so that the `api_user` can:

- Connect to Proxmox through the API
- Create, remove, modify Proxmox VMs
- Access (CRUD) Proxmox storage

1. Create `api_user` via the Proxmox UI
- Login to the Proxmox UI (typically as root@pam or as a user with the equivalent permissions)
- Navigate to 'Datacenter' in top left corner of the UI
- Expand the 'Permissions' pane in the center of the UI
- Navigate to Permissions > Users in the center of the UI
  - Click Users
  - Click Add
    - Make sure that the 'Advanced' checkbox is checked
    - Create a user called `api_user` (or whatever you want to call it)
    - The realm should be set to `pve` or 'Proxmox VE Authentication server' (i.e. do not create a user account and use PAM for authentication)
    - Group should be set to `admins`
    - Make sure that 'enabled' is checked
    - Make sure that 'expire' is set to 'never'
    - Do *not* set a password for the user, unless it is required
    - Click OK
2. Create `api_token` via the Proxmox UI
- Navigate to Permissions > API Tokens in the center of the UI
  - Click the Add button
    - Select User from the drop down menu
    - Give the token ID a name
    - Uncheck Privilege Separation
    - Make sure that Expire is set to 'never'
    - Click OK
    - This is the *only* time that your Proxmox API token will be shown in clear text.  Please store it in a safe space, as it will be required when configuring `secrets.yml` in the next section of this document.
3. Login to the Proxmox node via SSH
- Become root: `sudo su -`
- Add `api_user` to the correct role.  For example: `pveum acl modify / -user api_user@pve -role Administrator`
- If 'Administrator' is too broad a role, you can show which roles might be more amenable permissions wise: `pvesh get /access/roles --output-format yaml`.  Then select a more appropriate role for `api_user`, with the understanding that `api_user` needs full access to manage VMs and CRUD access to the underlying storage.

If you want to do everything, as noted above, on the Proxmox (SSH) command line, as root, the procedure would look like this:

```
proxmox-ve-shell# pveum user add api_user@pve --comment "Proxmox API User" --enable 1 --groups admin --expire 0 # create api_user@pve, enabled, non expiring, assigned to admin group

proxmox-ve-shell# pveum user token add api_user@pve api_user_token -privsep 0 # create API token for api_user with the name of api_user_token, and disable privilege separation

proxmox-ve-shell# pveum acl modify / -user api_user@pve -role Administrator # allow api_user@pve to access everything -- given Administrator role rights
```
