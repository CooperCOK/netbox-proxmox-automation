# NetBox Key and Permissions

## Initial Configuration: NetBox API user + key

It is recommended that you do *not* create an API token for the NetBox 'admin' user.  Instead, create a new user in NetBox; then create a new permission for that API user -- that has sufficient read/write/modify permissions to modify the following object types in NetBox, at a minimum:

  - Devices (for VM cluster(s) hardware, if used)
  - Interfaces (devices and VMs)
  - VMs (groups, clusters, VMs)
  - VM disks

### Create NetBox User + Group
 
In the NetBox UI:

1. Navigate to Admin > Users
2. Create a new user called `api_user`, or a user of your choice
3. Navigate to Admin > Groups
4. Create a new group called `api_user_group`, or a group of your choice
5. Navigate to Admin > Users, select `api_user` (or the user that you created), click the Edit button, and associate `api_user` with the group that you just created.

### Create NetBox Permissions

In the Netbox UI:

1. Navigate to Admin > Permissions
2. Create a new permission called `api_user_permissions` (or whatever you want to call it) and ensure that this permission has read/write/update/delete rights for the object types, at a minimum, noted above.  Associate the user and/or group with the permission that you've created.

### Create NetBox API Token

While it is possible to use passwords with the Netbox Ansible collection, `netbox-proxmox-automation` does not allow this behavior.  Instead a NetBox API token is required.

In the NetBox UI:

1. Navigate to Admin > API Tokens
2. Add a new token, associating it with `api_user`, with the following characteristics: Write enabled (you can select other characteristics if you wish)

Once you've created a NetBox API token, store it some place safe in the meantime; (most) NetBox installations will obscure the API token once it's been created.
