## :warning:

If you see errors like this...

> ERROR   -  Config value 'theme': Unrecognised theme name: 'material'. The available installed themes are: mkdocs, readthedocs
> ERROR   -  Config value 'markdown_extensions': Failed to load extension 'pymdownx.tabbed'.
>            ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymdownx'

 Try uninstalling `mkdocs` from your package manager, (e.g. `brew uninstall mkdocs`) and just using the version installed by `pip`. It seems that `mkdocs` doesn't like it when you've installed it using different methods.

# Known Issues / Roadmap

## Known Issues
- *Only* supports SCSI disk types (this is possibly fine as Proxmox predomininantly provisions disks as SCSI)
- Does not currently support Proxmox VM creation to a Proxmox cluster, but is only node-based
- Needs better reconciliation on the NetBox end when Proxmox->NetBox discovery is used

## Roadmap -- Delivery
- DNS update support (requires NetBox `netbox-dns` plugin)
- Maybe evolve into to a NetBox plugin for Proxmox
